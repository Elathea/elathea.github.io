					<h2>The Engine</h2>
					<p>Descent Engine is free and open source software released under the permissive MIT license.</p>
					<p>This license grants users a number of freedoms:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You are free to use Descent Engine for any purpose</li>
						<li>You can study how Descent Engine works and modify it</li>
						<li>You can distribute unmodified and changed versions of Descent Engine, even commercially and under a different license (including proprietary licenses)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The third freedom has one restriction: the copyright notice and license statement of Descent Engine must be included in any redistributions. A derivative product may have a different license, but must still state in its documentation that it derives from the MIT-licensed Descent Engine.</p>		
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>User Works</h2>
					<p>Descent Engine's license terms and copyright do not apply to user content created with it; users are the sole copyright owners of their works and are free to license them as they see fit.</p>
					<p>However, any and all Descent Engine binaries distributed with a work are copies of the "Software" as defined in the license, and are required to include the copyright notice and license statement somewhere in their documentation.</p>
					<p>A note about the use of the engine and a link to the Descent Engine license page in your documentation or credits is an acceptable way to satisfy the license terms. Such license pages can currently be found at either:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://elathea.github.io/projects/descent-engine/license.html">elathea.github.io/projects/descent-engine/license.html</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/Elathea/Descent-Engine/blob/main/LICENSE.md">github.com/Elathea/Descent-Engine/blob/main/LICENSE.md</a></li>

					<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
					<p>We encourage users of Descent Engine to foster an open and collaborative community. While not mandatory, you can promote this ethos by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Exposing as much functionality of your work as possible to your users and avoiding obfuscation.</li>
						<li>Providing documentation for interacting with and modifying your work.</li>
						<li>Developing and supporting tools that enable the modification of your work, and not subverting such tools built by others.</li>
						<li>Refraining from taking legal action against the creation and distribution of modifications to your work (as long as it does not involve the redistribution of your work itself or assets contained within).</li>
					</ul>
